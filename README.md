# Multi-GPU NVIDIA Testing Suite & GPU Diagnostic Tool

## Overview
This repository provides two Python scripts for working with NVIDIA GPUs:

- **gpu_test.py**: A comprehensive suite for testing, benchmarking, and stress-testing single and multi-GPU setups (any CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU).
- **gpu_diagnostic.py**: A diagnostic and setup tool to identify and help fix common CUDA/GPU issues, including environment, driver, and PyTorch checks.

---

## Features
### gpu_test.py
- Checks for required Python packages (`torch`, `numpy`, `psutil`)
- Reports detailed GPU information (model, memory, compute capability)
- Tests individual GPU memory and compute performance
- Benchmarks multi-GPU data parallelism and communication
- Simulates NCCL collective operations
- Monitors system and GPU resource usage
- Optionally stress-tests all GPUs in parallel

### gpu_diagnostic.py
- Checks NVIDIA driver installation and version
- Verifies CUDA toolkit and runtime libraries
- Checks environment variables relevant to CUDA
- Diagnoses PyTorch CUDA support and installation
- Checks GPU device permissions and kernel modules
- Provides system information (OS, kernel, secure boot)
- Generates a shell script to fix common issues automatically

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed
- Python packages: `torch`, `numpy`, `psutil`

---

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```
2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy psutil
   ```
   - For PyTorch with CUDA, see: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

---

## Usage
### 1. GPU Diagnostic Tool
Run the diagnostic tool to check your system and generate a fix script if issues are found:
```bash
python3 gpu_diagnostic.py
```
- If issues are detected, a `fix_gpu_setup.sh` script will be generated with recommended actions.

### 2. Multi-GPU Testing Suite
Run the test suite to benchmark and stress-test your GPUs:
```bash
python3 gpu_test.py
```
- Follow the prompts for optional stress testing.
